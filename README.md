## Main insight (conclusion)
Economic Interconnectivity: The high correlations between tech, finance, and industrial sectors indicate a shared sensitivity to economic cycles and policy changes. When the economy is strong, these sectors tend to perform well together, and vice versa.

Energyâ€™s Influence: The energy sector's significant impact on CPI and Fed rates underscores its pivotal economic role. Fluctuations in energy prices can ripple to affect inflation rates and prompt monetary policy adjustments.

Policy Implications: The Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions appear strongly influenced by inflation trends, particularly those driven by energy prices. As energy prices rise, increasing inflation, the Fed may raise rates to cool the economy and bring inflation under control.
